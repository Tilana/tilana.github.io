An investigation by The BMJ shows the extent of the fossil fuel industry’s involvement in medical research, leading to fresh calls for academics and publishing companies to cut ties with such companies.

Over the past six years more than 180 articles in medical publications or medical articles in other publications have acknowledged funding by the fossil fuel industry, and an additional 1000 articles have authors who worked for a fossil fuel company or related organisation, The BMJ’s analysis found.

The full investigation with all ties between oil companies and medical researchers is available on [BMJ](https://www.bmj.com/content/387/bmj.q2589).
