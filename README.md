# tilana

This is the base for my personal website [tilana.github.io](https://tilana.github.io).

The jekyll theme is forked from [https://github.com/rhiannon-io/rhiannon-io.github.io](https://github.com/rhiannon-io/rhiannon-io.github.io) and GitHub Pages is used for hosting.


## Testing locally

To test locally, `jekyll` needs to be installed. Follow the instructions [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Then, run the following commands:
"""
    bundle install
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    """


## Deployment:

With every push to the ``master`` branch, the build with Gihub Actions is triggered.
